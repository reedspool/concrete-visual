* Installation

Tests in this repo rely my package =xstate-jest-tools= which I have not yet published to NPM.

=npm update= unfortunately does not work with github-installed modules. So, to install and to update, call this:

If you are using Emacs, you can just hit =C-c C-c= with your cursor in the following block.

TRYING THIS too
#+begin_src sh
npm install --save next-transpile-modules
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results silent raw
npm install -D https://github.com/reedspool/xstate-jest-tools \
    https://github.com/reedspool/concrete-parser \
    https://github.com/reedspool/concrete-interpreter \
    https://github.com/reedspool/inverted-promise
#+end_src
